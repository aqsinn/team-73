        <h2>HOC Event</h2>
        <p>The Hour of Code event was held at Cambridge Academy in the Ganjlik branch on November 2nd at 2:00 PM. Our main goal was to introduce children to the fundamental basics of programming through engaging puzzles and hands-on coding tasks. Agshin chose the location, coordinated with the course administration about our project, and they agreed to collaborate with us. We selected the “Minecraft Macəraçısı” module on code.org as our material based on the participants’ interests.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>We were a bit unprepared on the technical side. Before the event, we spent time preparing by reviewing the coding exercises, practicing our presentations, and ensuring that each team member understood their role. The day before the event, we visited the location which was going to host the event. While Agshin discussed parental consent for being filmed with the course owner and the parents, Ayan, Sevinj, and Oruj checked if the whiteboard and the laptops, which the course provided were working perfectly. We also checked that our devices were compatible with the whiteboard setup. However, upon arrival, we encountered an unexpected technical issue where we couldn’t connect any of our computers to the whiteboard. Despite our earlier checks, the HDMI cable provided by the course location started malfunctioning, which disrupted our initial plans. After several attempts to troubleshoot the issue on our own, we reached out to a teacher at the location for help. Their assistance was pivotal in resolving the technical problem, allowing us to proceed with the event smoothly.</p>

        <h2>Language Barriers and Communication</h2>
        <p>Another challenge we encountered was language differences. A few children had difficulty understanding the tasks because they were more familiar with Russian than Azerbaijani. This created some confusion, especially with the instructions, which were primarily in Azerbaijani. To address this, we had to adapt our communication style and provide additional explanations in Russian when necessary. We also encouraged the children to ask questions if they were unsure about anything, fostering a more inclusive environment. By the end of the event, we noticed that the children were more comfortable and engaged, which was a rewarding outcome for our team.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Overall, the Hour of Code event was a success despite the challenges we faced. The children showed great enthusiasm and curiosity about programming, and we were able to achieve our goal of introducing them to coding in a fun and interactive way. We learned valuable lessons about preparation, adaptability, and the importance of clear communication. We look forward to organizing more events in the future and continuing to inspire young minds in the world of technology.</p>
